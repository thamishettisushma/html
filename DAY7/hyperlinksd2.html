Education is the transmission of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge" title="knowledge wikipedia" target="_self"> knowledge</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill" title="skill wikipedia" target ="_self"> skills</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory#List_of_personality_traits" title="character wikipedia" target="_self"> character traits</a> and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School" title="school wikipedia" target="_self">schools</a>, following a curriculum.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonformal_learning" title="Non-formal wikipedia" target="_self"> Non-formal education</a> also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_education" title="informal wikipedia" target="_self"> informal education</a> entails unstructured learning through daily experiences.

Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_childhood_education" title="childhood" target="_blank">  early childhood education</a>, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.Other classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student-centered_learning" title="centered" target="_blank"> student-centered education</a>, and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education" title="physical education" target="_blank">  physical education</a>. Additionally, the term "education" can denote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state" title="mental states" target="_blank"> mental states</a> and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying educational phenomena.

The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are disagreements about the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_education#Aims_of_education" title="aims" target"_self"> aims of education</a> and the extent to which education differs from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination" title="indoctrination wikipedia" target="_blank"> indoctrination</a> by fostering critical thinking.

Essentially, education <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization" title="socializes" target="_self"> socializes</a> children into society by instilling cultural values and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm" title="norms wikipedia" target="_parent"> norms</a>, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In doing so, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions play a significant role in education. For instance, governments establish education policies to determine the timing of school classes, the curriculum, and attendance requirements. International organizations, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" title="UNESCO wikipedia" target="_top"> UNESCO</a>, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.
