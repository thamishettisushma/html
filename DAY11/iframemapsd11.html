    <h1><center>RED FORT</center></h1>
    <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila  is a historic fort in Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1639, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.
         Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.<br>
         On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. 
         Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts through the Public Address System of Indian Army Corps of Signals.</p>
